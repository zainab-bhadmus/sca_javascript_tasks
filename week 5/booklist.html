### The Reading List

_An object-oriented book-list!_

*   Create a class `BookList`
*   Create another class called `Book`

*   **BookLists** should have the following properties:
	*   Number of books marked as read
	*   Number of books marked not read yet
	*   A reference to the next book to read (book object)
	*   A reference to the current book being read (book object)
	*   A reference to the last book read (book object)
	*   An array of all the Books
*   Each **Book** should have several properties:
	*   Title
	*  Genre
	*  Author
	*   Read (true or false)
	*   Read date, can be blank, otherwise needs to be a [JS Date() object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date)
*   Every **Booklist** should have a few methods: 
	* .add(book)
		* should add a **book** to the books list.
	*   .finishCurrentBook()
		*   should mark the **book** that is currently being read as "read"
		*   Give it a read date of new Date(Date.now())
		*   Change the last **book** read to be the book that just got finished
		*   Change the current **book** to be the next book to be read
		*   Change the next **book** to be read property to be the first unread book you find in the list of books

*   **Booklists** and **Books** might need more methods than that. Try to think of more that might be useful.

var Book = function(title, genre, author, read, readdate) {
    this.title = title || "No Title";
    this.genre = genre "Fiction";
    this.author = author || "No Author";
    this.read = read || False; //short circuit evaluation makes this work as a default
    this.readDate = new Date(readdate);
  } 

  var BookList = function(books) {
    //books should be an array.
    if (!typeof books == "array") {
      books = false;
    }
    this.bookShelf = books || [];

    //check to see if we have books to process
    if (this.bookShelf.length > 0) {
    //Loop through all of the books in the "books" argument
        //Use the .add function to handle adding books, so we keep counts updated.
      
    } 

    this.add = function(book){
      this.bookShelf.push(book);
      //If a book has been read:
        //See if we have a .lastBook property - set if we don't.
        //Update the count of read books
      //If a book hasn't been read:
        //See if we have a .currentBook property. Set if we don't.
        //See if we have a .nextBook property as well - if we didn't set the .currentBook property, set the .nextBook property.
      //it should also update the number of books marked as read / unread
    }
    this.finishCurrentBook = function(){
      //We're going to have to modify the state of this thing pretty heavily.
      if (this.currentBook) {
        this.currentBook.read = true;
        this.lastBook = this.currentBook
        this.currentBook = this.nextBook
        // Now, we need to loop through and get the next book in the array that has read marked as "false"
        //we also need to go through and update the number of books marked as read, and as not read.
      } else {
        //error handling - put something here that says "you don't have a current book!"
      }
    }
