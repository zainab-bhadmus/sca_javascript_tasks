### The Game (advanced) - STRETCH (Start this when you're done with MVP)
Pick one of three games: Chess, Poker, or Roshambo (rock, paper, scissors). Roshambo is the easiest, followed by Poker, then Chess.

* Your game should have a **Game** object shat should be responsible for keeping track of it's state
	* State depends on the game, all games have players, but not all games have pieces, cards, or moves. try to plan out what your state will be first
	* Your game should keep a reference to **players**, and it should tell them whether or not they have won or lost
	* Your game should be able to look at the state of the players and execute a **turn**- this is where you put code that looks at the state of each player and evaluates the results of what happens when that player changes it's state
	* Some games will have multiple turns that will change the state of the game, while others (like roshambo) only have one turn that determines a win or a loss.
* You should have **Players** for your game, which should be a class
	* Each player should keep track of how many wins and losses it has
	* Players should keep track of their pieces, cards, or hands
* You should have a class for each **Piece**, **Card** or **Move**

It's up to you to do the rest of the design for this program! Ensure two players can be created in the console as classes, join a game, execute methods with moves, and one player can win each game.
